On my last team, I would have to RDP into countless servers each day. I made this tool so that I could avoid having to search IP addresses or remember the server's hostname. 

The only required input is the server's location number. After you input the location number, if the hostname can be resolved to an IP, the script then RDP's you into the server. I wanted to automate inputing credentials as well but was advised against doing so for compliance reasons.
